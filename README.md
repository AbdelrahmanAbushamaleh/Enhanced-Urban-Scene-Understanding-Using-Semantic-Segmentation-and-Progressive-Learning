# Enhanced-Urban-Scene-Understanding-Using-Semantic-Segmentation-and-Progressive-Learning
This project focuses on urban scene understanding through the use of semantic segmentation techniques combined with a progressive learning strategy. The goal is to improve how machines interpret and classify complex urban environments such as roads, vehicles, buildings, sidewalks, and pedestrians.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features

Implements semantic segmentation to label each pixel in an image with its corresponding class.

Utilizes progressive learning for improved model generalization and performance.

Designed for urban scene datasets (e.g., Cityscapes) to capture real-world complexities.

Helps in applications such as autonomous driving, smart city infrastructure, and urban planning.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Python, TensorFlow / PyTorch for deep learning.

Computer Vision techniques for preprocessing and augmentation.

Training pipeline with progressive learning stages for better accuracy and efficiency.

ðŸ”¹ Applications

Autonomous vehicles (road and object recognition).

Intelligent traffic monitoring.

Urban infrastructure analysis and planning.
