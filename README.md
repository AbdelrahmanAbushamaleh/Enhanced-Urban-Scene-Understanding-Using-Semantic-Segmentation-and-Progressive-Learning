# Enhanced-Urban-Scene-Understanding-Using-Semantic-Segmentation-and-Progressive-Learning
This project focuses on urban scene understanding through the use of semantic segmentation techniques combined with a progressive learning strategy. The goal is to improve how machines interpret and classify complex urban environments such as roads, vehicles, buildings, sidewalks, and pedestrians.
